<p>I was wondering how important and popular PHP is in Croatian web development circles so I decided to go through list of 20 most popular croatian webs using <a href="http://www.audience.com.hr/pages/display/reach" target="_blank"> gemius audience </a> list to locate sites using it.</p>
<p>In first 10 websites there are 5 of them (njuskalo.hr, dnevnik.hr, forum.hr, vecernji.hr & coolinarika.com ) and in the next 10 there are 5 more (blog.hr, show.hr, rtl.hr, igre123.net & moj-posao.net). 50%? Thats really a lot. </p>
<p>Other websites are using:</p>
<p>- Microsoft stack (index.hr, tportal.hr, bloger.hr, slobodnadalmacija.hr, mojtv.hr, bug.hr ),<br />
- Java (jutarnji.hr )<br />
- python (24sata.hr)<br />
- perl (oglasnik.hr)</p>
<p>The biggest one (net.hr) has multiple sites on subdomains that mainly use PHP & Java.</p>
<p>To gather this statistics, for some of the sites I already knew what technology they use, for some of them it was enough to read file extensions in URL's and for the rest of them I used firebug to read response headers.</p>
