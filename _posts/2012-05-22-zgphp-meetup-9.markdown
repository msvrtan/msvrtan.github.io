<p>This was 5th session based meetup (4 were beer driven ones in a local pub :) ) located in Mama, we are really happy that there is such a great location for organizing smaller comunity meetings in Zagreb.</p>
<p>Neven Falica (<a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/elkarrde" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) was speaking about LESS and Igor Vrdoljak ( <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/ivrdoljak" target="_blank">Twitter</a> ) talked about EzPublish platform. IMHO both speakers were very interesting and did a really good job but I might be not objective enough.</p>
<p>What really surprised me while organizing this PHP meetups is the speaker quality. We are a really small community and in average speakers here are much better then those I often see on local conferences which is pretty odd behavior but makes me happy :). Also visitors are not just potato bags sitting there doing nothing, there is always interaction with speakers and this is probably our greatest asset.</p>
<p>Unfortunately last few meetups number of visitors is starting to drop, we are not sure if we are going wrong way with the sessions or people are just not interested.</p>
<p>Comments and suggestions are welcomed, help me and Luka (<a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/lmuzinic">Twitter</a>) make this meetups even better. Of course any help with organization of events is most welcomed.</p>
