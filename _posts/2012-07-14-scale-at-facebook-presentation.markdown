<p>Although Aditya Agarwal's presentation is from 2010 we can learn a lot from them. Video is 60 minutes long&nbsp; and you can view it <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Scale-at-Facebook">here</a> together with the presentation.</p>
<p>It is a real must see for all developers and tech managers..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
