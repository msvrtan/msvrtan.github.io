<p>In the years ending the last century I started playing around with PHP, so happy to be writing small code snippets and exploring this brave new world of programming(I was using only plain old C before). Now I could build a GUI easily, connect to database or access my apps (I'am a little bit a shame to call it apps though) from anywhere in the world. After conquering each new 'feature' I wanted more. That usually meant hours or days of googling how to do stuff since I didn't have oportunity to ask anybody around. As much as I loved that exploration (and I love it now too) often I felt into begginer traps that destroyed some of my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Today I found a great new project called&nbsp;<a href="http://phpmentoring.org/">PHP Mentoring</a> and this reminded me how I was in a bad need of any kind of&nbsp;mentorship then. Few days ago <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/grmpyprogrammer">Chris Hartjes</a> was offering mentorship on testing with PHP and I'am so sorry to found about it late (all 3 positions were filled up). Although I have 13 years of working with PHP (only 6-7 for money :) I have a need to learn and no I'm not a shamed of it.</p>
<p>If you are a person interested in web development go to <a href="http://phpmentoring.org/">PHP Mentoring</a> and apply. I know I will..</p>
