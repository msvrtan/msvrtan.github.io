<p>This was my first international and PHP conference and I'm so happy that I was able to go. Unfortunately in Zagreb (and region) where I live there are no developer conferences at all, so when I found out about PHPDay in Verona (~500km from Zagreb by car) I was really thrilled.</p>
<p>It was so sad to work with PHP for more then a decade a not have even a chance to visit some conference sooner, a common problem when working in a small company or freelancing like I was for a number of years. This event was so inspiring that after next PHP conference I will try to take at least a week off work to play around with all the technologies, tips, tricks &amp; suggestions :)</p>
<p>Thanks to GrUSP folks for brilliant organization, speakers for great content and all visitors for a great time. Probably the greatest thanks go to my employer (Trikoder) for giving me a chance and resources to go. This means a really lot to me.</p>
