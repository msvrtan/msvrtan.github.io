A 17 year veteran of PHP development, from being a one mand band web developer, via focusing on PHP development in a team environment to being a technical analyst. While focusing more on technical requirements of projects then how apps behave or look, I found opportunity to build/maintain/develop multiple large scale PHP projects. I founded [ZgPHP][zgphp], PHP user group based in Zagreb and [WebCamp Zagreb][wczg], a language agnostic web development conference held in Zagreb and organized by multiple user groups.
