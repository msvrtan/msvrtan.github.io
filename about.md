My name is Miro Svrtan, I live in Zagreb,Croatia.

I am a professional PHP developer, started with PHP back in 1999 as a student. From being a one man band web developer, via focusing on PHP development in a team environment to being a technical analyst. While focusing more on technical requirements of projects then how applications behave or look, I found opportunity to build/maintain/develop multiple large scale PHP projects. 

From mid 2014 I have my own company [Null Development][nulldev], working remotely for EU based startups as Senior PHP developer, using Symfony2. While trying to create cleaner, better code that can be easily tested, I became daily TDD/BDD practitioner using PHPUnit, PHPSpec & Behat. 

With all the changes in PHP world last 5-6 years, I decided to focus more on backend development & ops work. I love my 15" MacBook, writing code in PHPStorm, running it in Vagrant, provision not only dev environment using Ansible but our staging & production servers to get the same environment everywhere. Most of my bugs are found by CircleCI or Travis CI before they hit staging or production.

I founded [ZgPHP][zgphp], PHP user group based in Zagreb and [WebCamp Zagreb][wczg], a language agnostic web development conference held in Zagreb and organized by multiple user groups. 

Technologies:

: developing in Linux / Nginx / MySQL
: mostly using Symfony2 this days
: developing on vagrant with Ansible provisioning
: doing ops too

Favourite buzzwords:

: Symfony2
: Vagrant
: Ansible
: Behat
: PHPSpec
: CI
: git
